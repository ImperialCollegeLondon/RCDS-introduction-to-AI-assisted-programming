# Introduction to AI-Assisted Programming

## Pre-Course Instructions

In order to complete this course, you will need to have a [GitHub](https://github.com/home) account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for free. You will also need to enable [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) in your Github account. Thare are free and paid for tiers of GitHub Copilot. Students and educators can get access to the Pro version through Github Education. You can register for this [here](https://github.com/edu). It may take up to 10 days to receive access. For this course you can probably make so with the free version, but you should register for GitHub Education to get the Pro version to use going forward.

There are several Jupyter notebooks (the files with the extension ```.ipynb```) present in this  repository. You may review them in advance if you want to, but you aren't required to.

## Webinar Instructions

To complete this course, you will need to attend the Microsoft Teams session. You should do this using the Microsoft Teams app, signed into your Imperial account, if you have one. You should have a working microphone and camera. 

## Face to Face Course Instructions

This course will take place in an ICT computer room and so laptops are not required but you may bring one if you wish.

## Self-Study

This course can be studied independently at your own pace. Make sure you have completed the pre-course instructions described above. Once your GitHub account is set up and registered with GitHub Education, open a Codespace as described below. You can then work your way through the jupyter notebooks in the the order they are numbered. Make sure to experiment with the tools and complete the exercises to gain experience of using the tools yourself.

## Accessing Course Materials

The easiest way to run the course materials in a GitHub Codespace (instructions below), which can be done on a computer room computer for a face to face session, or your own laptop. This requires no setup in advance past the pre-course instructions above. 

Alternatively, you may download the course materials on to your own computer, install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install the following extensions within VS Code:
* [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) 
* [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)
* [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
* [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)

## Opening a Codespace

This course is designed to run inside of a [Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview). A Codespace is a development environment hosted by GitHub directly from a repository. To use this, you will need to be signed into a GitHub account. To open the Codespace, click the green ```Code``` button at the top right of the repository. Make sure you're in the ```Codespaces``` tab and click the ```Create New Codespace on Master``` button. This will create a Codespace of your own. This will take a minute or so to initialise. You may be asked to reload the page. If so, do reload the page. If the Codespace seems to get stuck loading, reloading the page can often fix the problem.

Once your Codespace has initialised, it will remain associated with your GitHub account for around a month, when it will expire. Your Codespace will be given a name like "fuzzy-barnacle" so you can identify it. To reopen it on a future occasion, click the ```Code``` button again, then select the Codespace, click ```Open```, then ```Open in Browser```.

To download the content of the files within the Codespace, open the Files tab on the left, select the files, right click and click ```Download``` button. Alternatively, if you're familiar with GitHub, you can open the source control tab on the left, you can commit and push changes. This will fork the repository with your changes. Either of these options will allow you to keep a copy of the course notes with your solutions to the exercises, etc.
