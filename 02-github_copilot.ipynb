    "[GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot) is a tool produced by GitHub that is powered by GPT-4. It is a separate tool to Microsoft Copilot, which you used earlier. Th overlap in name is partially due to the fact that GitHub is owned by Microsoft. \n",
    "\n",
    "Github Copilot is not a free tool, but is available for free to all students via [GitHub Education](https://github.com/edu).\n",
    "\n",
    "Copilot is designed to integrate directly with a number of different code editors, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)\n",
    "* [Vim/NeoVim](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-github-copilot-code-suggestions-in-your-editor?tool=vimneovim)\n",

    "- **GitHub Copilot**: This provides code suggestions and completions in the editor window. The extension is [here](vscode:extension/github.copilot).\n",
    "- **GitHub Copilot Chat**: This provides a chat interface to Copilot, allowing you to ask questions and get code suggestions. It can also interact with code in the editor window. The extension is [here](vscode:extension/github.copilot-chat).\n",
    "\n",
    "These extensions are designed to work together and you will typically have both installed. If you're running this notebook in GitHub Codespaces, these extensions should already be installed. If you're running this notebook locally, you can install them by clicking the links above and clicking the \"Install\" button. in order for these extensions to work, you will need to be logged into your GitHub account in VS Code, and to have registered for the GitHub Education programme with the same account.\n",

Alternatively, you can press `Ctrl` and the right arrow key to select just the next word. This can be helpful if some, but not all, of the suggestion is appropriate. This autocompletion will work in a number of different contexts, including code cells in Jupyter Notebooks, or within a ```.py``` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The autocompletion is aware of the code around your cursor, and will suggest completions based on this context. It can use functions already in the code, and can infer a likely purpose of the next piece of code based on the code that has already been written. Sometimes, writing a comment will help guide Copilot to suggest relevant code to you.\n",
