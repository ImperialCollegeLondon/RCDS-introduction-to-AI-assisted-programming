    "# Examining Existing Code\n",
    "\n",
    "One way we can use Copilot is to understand existing code. This can be useful when we receive someone else's code, when try to understand new code from another source (such as examples from the web), or when Copilot or another tool has generated code for us. Using Copilot, or a similar tool to explain the code can help us to understand it and integrate it into our own codebase, and to expand our knowledge of what is possible in the language."

    "## Understanding Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to get an explanation of the code is by highlighting it then writing a message in the Copilot chat asking it to explain it. Copilot will often try to break it down into stages, giving a high-level explanation. Some useful follow-up questions might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What problem does the code solve?\n",
    "* When might I use this code? \n",
    "* What does the line containing [X] do?\n",
    "* Which of these functions should I call to achieve [X]?\n",
    "* What does the syntax [X] mean?\n",
    "* Tell me more about the function [X].\n",

    "* What data type is variable [X]?\n",
    "* What is the purpose of the function [X]?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of questions you could ask - the key is to take a moment to consider the code, what you understand, what you don't, and how you want to use the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Copilot will give better explanations to smaller pieces of code. If the code is thousands of lines spread across multiple source files, it may struggle to give a coherent explanation that identifies the key points of the code.\n",

    "### Exercise: Understanding Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The code cell below contains some code that you might not understand completely. It deliberately lacks comments and documentation, although the variable names are reasonable. Ask Copilot to explain this code to you. Ask any follow-up questions you think are relevant and would help you understand the code better. If there are any bits of syntax you don't understand, ask Copilot to explain those too."

Experiment, and see what you can learn!\n",

It may be necessary to specify the language you are interested in, as Copilot may not be able to infer it from the context.\n",
